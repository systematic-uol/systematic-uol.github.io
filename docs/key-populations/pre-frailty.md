# Pre-Frailty
The pre-frailty segment reflects mid-life through retirement with a focus on multiple organ disorder, decompensation/failure of adapted psychosocial mechanisms (early retirement, life-transitions, suicide risk), hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes (menopause), cognition and neurodegeneration (dementia) and musculoskeletal decline – with commonly missed opportunities to prevent frailty among people living with MLTC.
